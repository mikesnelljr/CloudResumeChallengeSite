                I would like to start off by saying that I am by no means a
                professional web developer. With that in mind, I decided to
                start with a template, reverse engineer it and then customize. I
                got the template for this site from html5up.net and this
                particular template is called "hyperspace". I spent more time on
                this part of the project than I probably should have but what
                can I say? Creative works are an outlet of mine. So, why not
                give it the ol' razzle dazzle while I duct tape some things
                together?

                If you are curious about the artwork on the site (checkered orb
                image, about me section background with the guy touching the
                computer, the retro sun blog image and others) - they are some
                of my creations. The perspective line artwork in the background
                on the home section came with the hyperspace template.

                Initializing CI/CD - GitHub, AWS Codepipeline & S3
              </h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                From the beginning of this project, I knew I needed to use CI/CD
                to make sure that the project remained efficient from a
                management perspective right from the start. Since I work from 2
                different machines (desktop and laptop while on the go), I
                needed my files to remain current & consistent on both machines
                as I developed the bones of this site and to have the middleman
                in place for when I pushed it to S3 (more on that later). I
                chose GitHub for this since I already had some experience using
                GitLab throughout my degree program recently and wanted to take
                this opportunity to get more familiar with GitHub as well.
                <br /><br />
                Once I had the foundation for the site laid out (main page, blog
                page and this blogpost), I was ready to push the repository into
                an S3 bucket. For this, I set up a code pipeline in AWS using
                you guessed it... "AWS Codepipeline". This process is straight
                forward as codepipeline can interact with GitHub directly for
                the initial sync and listen for updates. With the codepipeline
                set up, my repo was now placed in an S3 bucket and maintains a 1
                to 1 replica of my repo. Making it easy and efficient to update
                my pages
                <br /><br />
                <img src="../images/CICD.jpeg" style="width: 80%" />
                <br /><br />
                Any time I update my repo and push it to GitHub, AWS
                Codepipeline will pull it and update my S3 bucket which will be
                used as the origin for CloudFront.
                <br /><br />

                Cloundfront & Enhancing CI/CD - AWS Cloudfront, Lambda,
                Codepipeline
              </h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Now that I had my files synced to my GitHub repo, I needed to
                create the Cloudfront Distribution to make my static site
                available in a secure and efficient way. This means keeping my
                origin S3 bucket private and allowing Cloudfront to do the
                talking. In light of recent news (<a
                  href="https://blog.limbus-medtec.com/the-aws-s3-denial-of-wallet-amplification-attack-bc5a97cc041d"
                  style="color: aqua"
                  >"The AWS S3 Denial of Wallet amplification attack"</a >) posted over on medium and all the backlash from it, I was certainly a little extra paranoid about how I am going about creating this project now... At this point, it meant making sure I selected a hard to guess S3 bucket name to keep my resources as private as possible and using that bucket going forward. Though there has been correspondence from AWS saying they are looking into resolving this issue. And I would hope we see some promising updates coming up after this much heat! 
                  <br /><br />
                I decided to purchase my domain name through a 3rd party
                (Namecheap) to isolate it from this particular AWS account in
                case I want to easily move it some other day. Setting up the
                distribution and plugging in my domain was fairly
                straightforward as there are reputable guides from both AWS and
                Namecheap for this. Once my domain was registered, I used ACM
                (Amazon Credential Manager) to procure the SSL certificate. With
                the domain and SSL in hand, I added them to the Cloudfront
                distro configuration & made the corresponding records in
                Namecheap.
                <br /><br />
                With the Cloudfront distro up and running fine, there was a
                tweak I wanted to make to increase the QoL while working on this
                project/website. The CICD enhancement is automating the
                Cloudfront cache invalidations when the S3 bucket gets fresh
                files from GitHub in the Codepipeline.
                <br /><br />
                To accomplish the automated Cloudfront invalidations, I added an
                additional stage to the Codepipeline after the s3 bucket gets
                populated. This additional stage runs a Lambda function that
                does the heavy lifting for this automation. The Lambda function
                itself contains code sourced from a GitHub repo posted by the
                user "dhruv9911". The code is setup to use user parameters for
                the Cloudfront ID and paths to be invalidated, which can be set
                within the action group of the codepipeline stage. With this
                Lambda function and additional codepipeline stage in place. The
                entire CI/CD process is automated and every update that I make
                to the site gets pushed to Cloudfront as soon as updated files
                arrive in the S3 bucket.
                <br /><br />

                Completed AWS Static Website Architectual Diagram & Conclusions

              <p>
                This current version of the static site project was mostly me
                winging it with some things and using the AWS console a good
                bit. Next, I plan to redo the setup now that I have the base
                layer for the site and can focus on a more streamlined and
                professional AWS integration. With version 2, I plan to use the
                CLI and IaC more to set things up, explore different CI/CD
                routes and implement new features. Once version 2 is rolled out,
                this project will be superseded and that will replace the main
                project tile on the home page but I'll probably keep this blog
                post for it here as documentation of my journey in the blog
                portion of the site.
                <br /><br />
                In the long run, I am not sure if I will continue to use a
                static site or eventually cave in and use a more robust
                CMS/dynamic solution. Only time will tell. For now and the
                foreseeable future, I hope you enjoy your stay here at the
                static mikesnell.cloud.
