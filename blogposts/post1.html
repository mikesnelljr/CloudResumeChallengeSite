                I would like to start off by saying that I am by no means a
                professional web developer. With that in mind, I decided to
                start with a template, reverse engineer it and then customize. I
                got the template for this site from html5up.net and this
                particular template is called "hyperspace". I spent more time on
                this part of the project than I probably should have but what
                can I say? Creative works are an outlet of mine. So, why not
                give it the ol' razzle dazzle while I duct tape some things
                together?

                If you are curious about the artwork on the site (checkered orb
                image, about me section background with the guy touching the
                computer, the retro sun blog image and others) - they are some
                of my creations. The perspective line artwork in the background
                on the home section came with the hyperspace template.

                Initializing CI/CD - GitHub, AWS Codepipeline & S3
              </h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                From the beginning of this project, I knew I needed to use CI/CD
                to make sure that the project remained efficient from a
                management perspective right from the start. Since I work from 2
                different machines (desktop and laptop while on the go), I
                needed my files to remain current & consistent on both machines
                as I developed the bones of this site and to have the middleman
                in place for when I pushed it to S3 (more on that later). I
                chose GitHub for this since I had already had some experience
                using GitLab throughout my degree program recently and wanted to
                take this opportunity to get more familiar with GitHub as well.
                <br /><br />
                Once I had the foundation for the site laid out (main page, blog
                page and this blogpost), I was ready to push the repository into
                an S3 bucket. For this, I set up a codepipeline in AWS using you
                guessed it... "AWS Codepipeline". This process is straight
                forward as codepipeline has the ability to interact with GitHub
                directly for the initial sync and listen for updates. With the
                codepipeline set up, my repo was now placed in an S3 bucket and
                maintains a 1 to 1 replica of my repo. Making it easy and
                efficient to update my pages.
                <br /><br />
                <img src="../images/CICD.jpeg" style="width: 80%" />
                <br /><br />
                Any time I update my repo and push it to GitHub, AWS Codepiple
                will pull it and update my S3 bucket which will be used as the
                origin for cloudfront.
